#VeriHarvest: AI, IoT & Blockchain-Powered Food Authentication System

Overview
VeriHarvest is an advanced food authentication and safety platform that integrates AI, IoT, and Blockchain to ensure real-time, tamper-proof verification of food products. Our solution aims to combat food fraud, enhance supply chain transparency, and empower consumers and regulators with reliable data.

Problem Statement
Food fraud and contamination result in over $40 billion in annual losses globally, endangering consumer health. Current blockchain solutions rely on static data, making them vulnerable to tampering and delayed detection. Consumers and regulators lack real-time verification and transparency, highlighting the need for a secure and automated food authentication system.

Solution
VeriHarvest leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a robust and reliable food verification system:

AI-Driven Food Fingerprinting: Uses hyperspectral imaging and pattern recognition to detect adulteration.

IoT-Powered Monitoring: Ensures real-time compliance with storage and transportation standards.

Blockchain-Based Traceability: Maintains immutable records, preventing fraud and enabling end-to-end transparency.

Dynamic Trust Scoring: AI-driven evaluation to identify low-quality or fraudulent food batches.

Consumer & Regulatory Dashboard: Provides real-time insights into food safety and compliance.

Tech Stack
VeriHarvest is built using a robust and scalable tech stack:

Frontend: React.js (Web), Flutter/React Native (Mobile)

Backend: Node.js (Express) / Python (FastAPI)

AI Processing: Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch)

IoT Integration: MQTT, AWS IoT, Raspberry Pi, ESP32

Blockchain: Solidity (Ethereum), Hyperledger (Private Blockchain)

Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB (for off-chain data)
